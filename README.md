# TN_Wire Cut CNC

**TN_Wire Cut CNC** is an open source 2D foam cutter built for desktop use. The is designed to be versatile, affordable, and user friendly. Now artisans, Students and business professionals can free their imagination. 

Instead of bits or lasers, the main tool of this machine is a hot wire, or a special type of resistance wire which gets really hot when current flows through it. The hot wire melts or vaporizes the foam when passing through it and so we can precisely and easily get any shape we want.

TN_Wire CNC has been developed using standard [Fab Lab equipment](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U-jcBWOJEjBT5A0N84IUubtcHKMEMtndQPLCkZCkVsU/pub?single=true&gid=0&output=html) and [technique](http://fab.academany.org/2020/schedule.html). TN_Wire CNC was built in [FabLab ENIM](https://www.facebook.com/FAB-LAB-ENIM-Scale-UP-109836517566611) by **Mouhib Mohammed IBrahim** and the help of a lot of people (Desingers & Engineers).

TN_Wire CNC brings the advantages of an open source development:

* full awareness about how FabLab machines works

* reproducible design

* possibility to customize the machine and/or to build new ones

* local self-fixing and self-production of the machine parts

* community can use and improve the design

* cheap alternative to have a desktop machine in the FabLab
